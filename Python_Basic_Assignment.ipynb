Its popularity stems from several factors\n","including:\n","\n","Ease of learning: Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and easy to grasp, making it an excellent choice for beginners.\n","Versatility: It can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.\n","Large community and extensive libraries: Python has a vast and active community, which has contributed to a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that simplify development.\n","Strong corporate backing: Major companies like Google, Netflix, and Spotify use Python extensively, further solidifying its position.\n","Portability: Python code can run on various operating systems without modification.\n","\n","**2.What is an interpreter in Python?**\n","\n","---An interpreter in Python is a program that directly executes code line by line, without compiling it into machine code first.When you run a Python script, the interpreter reads each line of code, translates it into instructions the computer can understand, and immediately executes those instructions.This is different from a compiler which translates the entire program into machine code before execution.The interpreted nature of Python makes it more flexible and easier to debug as you can run and test small parts of your code as you write them.\n","\n","**3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python?**\n","\n","\n","---Pre-defined keywords in Python are special words that have a specific meaning and purpose in the language.They are reserved and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers.These keywords are fundamental building blocks of the Python language and are used to define the structure and logic of your code.\n","\n","Examples of Python keywords include:\n","if, else, elif (for conditional statements)\n","for, while (for loops)\n","def (to define functions)\n","class (to define classes)\n","import (to import modules)\n","True, False, None (special constant values)\n","There are many more keywords in Python,each serving a specific role. Understanding and proper usage of these keywords is essential for writing correct and functional Python code.\n","\n","**4.Can keywords be used as variable names?**\n","\n","\n","---No, pre-defined keywords in Python cannot be used as variable names. They are reserved words that have specific meanings within the Python language, and using them as variable names would cause a syntax error.\n","\n","**5.What is mutability in Python?**\n","\n","\n","---In Python, mutability refers to whether the state of an object can be changed after it is created.\n","Mutable objects can be modified after they are created. That means we can change their contents or elements without creating a new object.Examples of mutable objects include lists, dictionaries and sets.\n","example:\n","# Mutable list\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","my_list.append(4) # Modifies the original list\n","print(my_list)    # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","\n","\n","**6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?**\n","\n","\n","---Lists and tuples are both ordered collections of items in Python but they differ fundamentally in their mutability.\n","Lists are mutable because they are designed to be dynamic collections where elements can be added, removed, or modified after the list is created. This makes lists suitable for situations where you need to change the size or content of your collection frequently. Python implements lists in a way that allows for in-place modification of their underlying data structure.\n","Tuples are immutable because they are intended to represent fixed collections of items. Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its size or the values of its elements. This immutability makes tuples useful for representing records or collections of related items where the integrity of the data needs to be preserved. Since tuples are immutable, Python can sometimes optimize their storage and access, and they can be used as keys in dictionaries (which requires the keys to be immutable).\n","In essence,the difference in mutability reflects their intended use cases like\n","Use lists when you need a collection that can change.\n","Use tuples when you need a collection that should remain constant.\n","This design choice provides flexibility and allows Python to optimize performance for different types of collections.\n","\n","**7.What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?**\n","\n","\n","---The == and is operators in Python are used for comparison, but they compare different things:\n","\n","The == operator compares the values of two objects. It checks if the objects have the same content or not. The 'is' operator compares the identity of two objects. It checks if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory or not.\n","\n","**8.What are logical operators in Python?**\n","\n","\n","---Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements. The main logical operators are bellow:\n","\n","and: Returns True if both statements are true.\n","or: Returns True if at least one of the statements is true.\n","not: Reverses the result; returns True if the statement is false.\n","\n","**9.What is type casting in Python?**\n","\n","\n","---In Python, type casting (also known as type conversion) is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. This is often necessary when you need to perform operations that require specific data types, or when you want to change how data is represented.\n","\n","Python provides built-in functions for type casting, such as:\n","\n","int(): Converts a value to an integer.\n","float(): Converts a value to a floating-point number.\n","str(): Converts a value to a string.\n","list(): Converts a sequence (like a tuple or string) to a list.\n","tuple(): Converts a sequence (like a list or string) to a tuple.\n","dict(): Creates a dictionary.\n","set(): Creates a set.\n","Here's an example:\n","\n","# Converting an integer to a float\n","num_int = 10\n","num_float = float(num_int)\n","print(num_float)  # Output: 10.0\n","\n","# Converting a string to an integer\n","str_num = \"123\"\n","int_num = int(str_num)\n","print(int_num)    # Output: 123\n","\n","# Converting a list to a tuple\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","my_tuple = tuple(my_list)\n","print(my_tuple)   # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n","\n","It's important to note that not all type conversions are possible or will result in a meaningful value. For example, trying to convert a string that is not a valid number into an integer will raise an error.\n","\n","**10.What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?**\n","\n","\n","---The difference between implicit and explicit type casting in Python lies in whether the conversion happens automatically (implicitly) or is done manually by the programmer (explicitly).\n","\n","Implicit Type Casting (Coercion)\n","\n","This happens automatically by the Python interpreter during certain operations.\n","Python converts one data type to another to avoid errors and ensure the operation can be performed.\n","This usually occurs when performing operations between different numeric types (e.g., adding an integer and a float). Python will implicitly convert the integer to a float before performing the addition.\n","Example:\n","\n","num_int = 10\n","num_float = 5.5\n","sum = num_int + num_float  # Implicit conversion of num_int to float\n","print(sum)  # Output: 15.5\n","print(type(sum)) # Output: <class 'float'>\n","Explicit Type Casting (Type Conversion)\n","\n","This is done manually by the programmer using built-in type conversion functions (like int(), float(), str(), etc.).\n","You explicitly tell Python to convert a value from one type to another.\n","This is necessary when Python cannot automatically convert the types or when you need to ensure a specific data type for an operation or variable.\n","Example:\n","\n","num_str = \"100\"\n","num_int = int(num_str) # Explicit conversion of num_str to int\n","print(num_int)   # Output: 100\n","print(type(num_int)) # Output: <class 'int'>\n","\n","num_float_str = \"10.5\"\n","num_float = float(num_float_str) # Explicit conversion of num_float_str to float\n","print(num_float) # Output: 10.5\n","print(type(num_float)) # Output: <class 'float'>\n","In summary:\n","\n","Implicit casting is automatic and handled by Python.\n","Explicit casting is manual and performed by the programmer using conversion functions.\n","Implicit casting is generally safe and convenient for simple operations, while explicit casting gives you more control and is necessary when automatic conversion isn't possible or desired.\n","\n","**11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?**\n","\n","---Conditional statements in Python, such as if, elif, and else, are used to control the flow of execution in a program based on whether a certain condition is true or false. They allow your code to make decisions and execute different blocks of code depending on the state of our data or the outcome of a comparison. This enables us to create programs that can respond dynamically to different situations.\n","\n","**12.How does the elif statement work?**\n","\n","---The elif statement in Python is short for \"else if\". It's used after an if statement (and optionally after other elif statements) to check for another condition if the preceding if or elif conditions were false. If an elif condition is true, the code block associated with that elif is executed, and the rest of the conditional structure is skipped. You can have multiple elif statements after an if statement.\n","\n","example:\n","\n","score = 85\n","\n","if score >= 90:\n","    print(\"Excellent!\")\n","elif score >= 80:\n","    print(\"Very Good!\")\n","elif score >= 70:\n","    print(\"Good!\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"Needs Improvement.\")\n","\n","In this above example the code first checks if score is greater than or equal to 90. Since it's not, it moves to the next condition.\n","The elif score >= 80: condition is checked. Since score is 85, this condition is true, and \"Very Good!\" is printed.\n","The remaining elif and else blocks are skipped because a condition has already been met.\n","You can change the value of score and run the cell to see how the output changes based on the conditions.\n","\n","**13.What is the difference between for and while loops?**\n","\n","---The main difference between for and while loops in Python is how they determine when to stop iterating:\n","\n","for loops: These are typically used when you know the number of times you want to iterate or when you want to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range). The loop runs for each item in the sequence.\n","while loops: These are used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. The loop continues to execute as long as the condition remains true and stops when the condition becomes false. You need to make sure that the condition will eventually become false to avoid an infinite loop.\n","In short we can say 'for' loops are for definite iteration (when you know how many times to loop), and 'while' loops are for indefinite iteration (when you loop based on a condition).\n","\n","**14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop :**\n","\n","---A common scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop is when you need to repeat an action until a certain condition is met, and you don't know in advance how many times you'll need to repeat it.\n","\n","For example, imagine you are writing a program that simulates a game where the user needs to guess a random number. You want to keep asking the user for a guess until they guess the correct number. In this case, you don't know how many guesses it will take, so a while loop is a good fit:\n","\n","import random\n","\n","secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n","guess = 0\n","\n","while guess != secret_number:\n","  guess = int(input(\"Guess the secret number (between 1 and 100): \"))\n","  if guess < secret_number:\n","    print(\"Too low! Try again.\")\n","  elif guess > secret_number:\n","    print(\"Too high! Try again.\")\n","\n","print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the secret number: {secret_number}\")\n","\n","In this above example the while guess != secret_number: condition keeps the loop running as long as the user's guess is not equal to the secret number. The loop will continue to iterate an unknown number of times until the condition becomes false (i.e., when the user guesses correctly). Using a for loop would not be appropriate here because we don't have a predefined sequence or number of iterations.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"eA_xyBaI_50L"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Python Basics Questions:**\n","\n","**B.Practical questions:**"],"metadata":{"id":"KZ7ltQ8E_V_X"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**1.Write a Python program to print \"Hello, World!\":**"],"metadata":{"id":"BjI8UpvXBVmc"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(\"Hello, World!\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"H0eTjuJdBm66","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757682330397,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":95,"user":{"displayName":"Anindita Sana","userId":"01503289125964552060"}},"outputId":"db156704-034f-4547-f33d-e7593d5c1158"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, World!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**2.Write a Python program that displays your name and age:**"],"metadata":{"id":"RrQyCVtsCEfz"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n","age = input(\"Enter your age: \")\n","\n","print(\"Your name is:\", name)\n","print(\"Your age is:\", age)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"596hGVFgCgfp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757682571496,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":40619,"user":{"displayName":"Anindita Sana","userId":"01503289125964552060"}},"outputId":"e7de0f66-b191-4452-8eee-c040ee51f5ac"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter your name: Anindita\n","Enter your age: 18\n","Your name is: Anindita\n","Your age is: 18\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"euEEMf5EEt81"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**3.Write code to print all the pre-defined keywords in Python using the keyword library:**"],"metadata":{"id":"rJg7HiiuDC-A"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import keyword\n","print(keyword.kwlist)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"n1Is1FH-Dl7w","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757682759340,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":70,"user":{"displayName":"Anindita Sana","userId":"01503289125964552060"}},"outputId":"ca545bbf-73db-4998-aa7a-c70007bb8dc4"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**4.Write a program that checks if a given word is a Python keyword:**"],"metadata":{"id":"H4QBYqbmDt5B"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import keyword\n","\n","word = input(\"Enter a word to check: \")\n","\n","if keyword.iskeyword(word):\n","  print(f\"'{word}' is a Python keyword.\")\n","else:\n","  print(f\"'{word}' is not a Python keyword.\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"6P-kL6o0D_t1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757682915925,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":8246,"user":{"displayName":"Anindita Sana","userId":"01503289125964552060"}},"outputId":"de905ec9-7cd2-4428-e136-571ad2773f51"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter a word to check: else\n","'else' is a Python keyword.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**5.
